        "\n",
        "**Answer**-\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. **Linearity**:\n",
        "\n",
        "There must be a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "This means: as X increases, Y changes at a constant rate.\n",

        "2. **Independence of Errors:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (errors) — the differences between actual and predicted values — should be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, one error should not depend on another.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Homoscedasticity (Equal Variance)\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance of the errors should remain constant across all values of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "That means the spread of residuals should be similar everywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "The errors (residuals) should follow a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        " Check: A histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals should look approximately normal.\n",
        "\n",
        " 🔹 5. No Multicollinearity\n",
        "\n",
        "This applies more to multiple regression, but in SLR it means:\n",
        "\n",
        "The independent variable (X) should not be a linear combination of other variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Since SLR has only one X, this assumption is automatically satisfied.)\n",

        "Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is mainly used for classification problems. It helps to predict the probability of an outcome that can only have two possible values, such as Yes/No, 0/1, True/False, or Pass/Fail.\n",
        "Although it has the word “Regression” in its name, it is actually used for classification tasks, not for predicting continuous numeric values.\n",

        "\n",
        "The R-squared (R²) metric, also known as the coefficient of determination, is an important measure used in regression analysis to evaluate how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable. In simple terms, it tells us how closely the data fit the regression line or how well the model represents the real-world data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The value of R-squared ranges between 0 and 1. An R² value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable, while an R² value of 1 means the model explains all of the variability perfectly. Generally, a higher R² value means a better fit of the model to the data, but it does not always guarantee that the model is good—sometimes, a very high R² can indicate overfitting if unnecessary variables are included.\n",

        " For example, if we build a regression model to predict house prices based on the size of the house, and we get an R² value of 0.85, it means that 85% of the variation in house prices can be explained by the model, while the remaining 15% is due to other factors not included in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        " In conclusion, the purpose of the R-squared metric is to measure the goodness of fit of a regression model. It helps us understand how well the model’s predictions match the observed data, and it serves as an important tool for evaluating and comparing different regression models.\n"
